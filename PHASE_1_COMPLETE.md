3. **Admin reviews quote** in `/admin/quotes`
4. **Admin clicks quote** to see details in `/admin/quotes/{id}`
5. **Admin contacts customer** via Call/Email/WhatsApp buttons
6. **Admin updates status:**
   - **"Quoted"** - After sending pricing
   - **"Converted"** - When customer confirms order
   - **"Rejected"** - If customer declines
7. **Quote tracked** in system for future reference
