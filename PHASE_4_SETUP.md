## üîÑ Critical: Restart Your Dev Server

The database migration succeeded! Now you need to:

## üìã What's Implemented

### 1. Database Models

```prisma
model Customer {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email       String   @unique
  password    String   // Hashed with bcrypt
  name        String
  phone       String?
  companyName String?
  
  // Default delivery address
  address     String?
  city        String?
  state       String?
  pincode     String?
  
  orders      Order[]  // Link to their orders
}

model Order {
  // ... existing fields
  customerId  Int?          // NULL for guest orders
  customer    Customer?     // Link to customer account
}
```

### 2. Customer Authentication (`src/lib/customer-auth.ts`)

**Functions:**
- `createCustomerSession()` - Creates JWT session cookie (30 days)
- `getCustomerSession()` - Gets current logged-in customer
- `deleteCustomerSession()` - Logs out customer
- `hashPassword()` - Bcrypt password hashing
- `verifyPassword()` - Password verification

**Security:**
- JWT tokens with HS256 algorithm
- HttpOnly cookies (can't be accessed by JavaScript)
- 30-day expiration
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)

### 3. API Endpoints

#### POST `/api/customer/register`
**Purpose:** Create new customer account

**Request:**
```json

  "name": "Rajesh Kumar",
  "email": "rajesh@example.com",

}
```

## üí° Cash on Delivery Flow

### How It Works:

1. **Customer places order** (guest or logged in)
2. **Order created** with status = PENDING
3. **Emails sent:**

4. **Admin (you) receives notification**
5. **You call customer** to confirm:
   - Verify order details
   - Confirm delivery address
   - Discuss payment (COD)
   - Give estimated delivery time
6. **Update order status** in admin panel:
   - PENDING ‚Üí CONFIRMED (after call)
   - CONFIRMED ‚Üí PROCESSING (preparing)
   - PROCESSING ‚Üí READY_TO_SHIP
   - READY_TO_SHIP ‚Üí SHIPPED (dispatched)
   - SHIPPED ‚Üí DELIVERED (cash collected)

### Why This Works:
- ‚úÖ No payment gateway fees (save 2-3%)
- ‚úÖ Personal touch with customers
- ‚úÖ Verify orders before preparing
- ‚úÖ Build customer relationships
- ‚úÖ Flexible payment options
- ‚úÖ Reduced fraud risk
