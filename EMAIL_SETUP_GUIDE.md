---

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key

1. **Sign up for Resend** (Free tier available)
   - Go to: https://resend.com/signup
   - Sign up with your email
   - Verify your email address

2. **Create API Key**
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí API Keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Name it: "Packlite Production"
   - Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

3. **Add Domain (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Domains
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Add your domain (e.g., `packlite.com`)
   - Follow DNS setup instructions
   - **Until verified**, use default: `onboarding@resend.dev`

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_api_key_here"
FROM_EMAIL="orders@yourdomain.com"  # Or use "onboarding@resend.dev" temporarily
ADMIN_EMAIL="aryanenterprises721@gmail.com"

# Application URL (for email links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Change to your production URL when deployed
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `re_your_api_key_here` with your actual Resend API key
- If you haven't verified a domain yet, use `FROM_EMAIL="onboarding@resend.dev"`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` is where you'll receive new quote notifications
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` should be your production URL (e.g., `https://packlite.com`) when deployed

---

### Step 3: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

That's it! Email notifications are now active. üéâ
